# The Full Story

## Where I Am

**Location**: Beit Shemesh, Israel

**Context**: Religious community, outside the Tel Aviv tech bubble. Not networking at Rothschild Blvd cafes. Not attending every meetup. Building production systems from here.

**Why it matters**: I operate differently than the typical Israeli tech ecosystem. That's not a bug, it's a feature.

---

## How I Work

### The Numbers
- **12,500 AI conversations** over 2.5 years
- **400,000+ messages** learning efficient AI tool usage
- **~8 hours** to build working RAG API (253K messages)
- **Solo** on all projects (no team, no outsourcing)

### The Pattern
1. Identify real problem (not tutorial problem)
2. Build minimum solution with AI assistance
3. Iterate to production quality
4. Ship and learn from real usage

**Not**:
- Complete course first, build later
- Memorize frameworks, reference when needed
- Join team, divide work

**But**:
- Build immediately, learn while building
- Use AI to accelerate, not replace understanding
- Ship complete systems solo

### The Tools
- **Claude Code**, **Cursor**, **Windsurf** - AI-first development
- **9 MCP servers** - Extended capabilities (Supabase, GitHub, etc.)
- **Platform-agnostic** - Vercel + Railway + Supabase + Google APIs + etc.

**Key insight**: I don't fight the tools. I orchestrate them.

## What I've Proven

### Production Systems Solo

**Sparkii RAG**: 253K message search with classification metadata + query routing
**Timeline**: Day 1 to working API
**Traditional team size**: 5 people
**Traditional timeline**: 3-6 months

**WOTC Tax Processing**: 3-tier microservices, 109-column DB, AI PDF extraction
**Timeline**: 3-4 weeks
**Traditional team size**: 5-7 people
**Traditional timeline**: 4-6 months

**Israeli Tech Corpus**: Podcast transcription + translation pipeline
**Volume**: 31 episodes + 75+ articles
**Languages**: Hebrew → English

### The Math

**What I Can Do Solo** ≈ **What 3-5 Developer Team Does**

- Faster (weeks vs months)
- Cheaper (1 person vs team salaries)
- Often better (no coordination overhead, deep focus)

**Not magic. Just**:
- Pattern recognition at scale (12,500 AI conversations)
- Efficient iteration (AI accelerates feedback loops)
- Platform orchestration (don't rebuild, combine existing services)
- Deep work (no meetings, no overhead)

## The Disconnect I See

### 2021 Hiring (What Companies Do)
- "Senior Full-Stack Developer, 5+ years, CS degree, ₪30k/month"
- Teams of 5-10 developers
- Multi-round interviews testing algorithm memorization
- Agile ceremonies and sprint planning

### 2025 Reality (What I Can Do)
- One person with Claude Code
- Production systems in days/weeks
- Platform-agnostic solutions
- Faster, cheaper, comparable/better quality

### Why The Gap Exists
1. **VCs demand headcount growth** - "Scaling" = hiring 50 people
2. **Risk aversion** - Known pattern (team of 10) feels safer than unknown (1 AI-native dev)
3. **Cultural inertia** - Israeli playbook (8200 → university → startup → scale team)
4. **Leaders don't know it's possible** - Most CTOs haven't used Claude Code for 2.5 years

### What This Means

I'm **2-3 years ahead** of the market's understanding.

**Question**: What do you do when you're right but early?

**Currently exploring**:
- Finding people who already get it
- Building something undeniable
- Waiting for market to catch up (2026-2027)

## Background & Context

### Self-Taught Path

**No CS degree.** No bootcamp. No formal programming education.

**How I learned**:
- 12,500 AI conversations systematically exploring patterns
- Building real systems that solve real problems
- Pattern recognition first-principles problem solving
- Learn just-in-time, not just-in-case

**Why this works**:
- High motivation (solving actual problems, not exercises)
- High retention (learned through application)
- Deep understanding (not surface-level tutorial knowledge)

### Neurodivergent Learning Style

**ADHD**: Deep hyperfocus on interesting problems. Struggle with structure/routine.

**How I adapted**:
- Work when in flow state (not 9-5 schedule)
- Build systems that interest me (high engagement)
- Use tools that reduce friction (AI assistance)

**Result**: Can produce more in hours of deep focus than days of scattered work.

### Religious Community

**Observant Jewish** in Beit Shemesh.

**Implications**:
- Friday afternoons + Saturdays off (Shabbat)
- Different cultural context than Tel Aviv tech
- Community ties (not relocating)

**Why it works**:
- Clear boundaries enable deep focus
- Different perspective than monoculture
- Proven remote work capability

## What I'm Looking For

### NOT Looking For:
- Traditional employment with 5-round interviews
- "Junior" roles despite proven capabilities
- Relocating to Tel Aviv
- Daily office presence
- "Send us your resume" companies
- Equity-only startups

### AM Looking For:
- **Companies/people who understand AI-native development**
- **Problem-first conversations** ("Can you solve X?")
- **Capabilities over credentials** (Show your work, not diplomas)
- **Remote-first or hybrid** (1-2 days max in-office)
- **Fair compensation** (Market rate for value delivered)

### The Right Fit

If you:
- Have real technical problems
- Value what someone can build over where they studied
- Understand what's possible with AI tools
- Offer flexibility (remote/hybrid)
- Provide fair compensation

**Then let's talk.**

## FAQs

### "Why no CS degree?"

Degrees optimize for breadth (know many things). I optimize for depth (solve real problems).

I've built systems that require understanding of:
- Vector databases (pgvector)
- Spatial queries (PostGIS)
- AI integration (RAG, embeddings)
- Microservices architecture
- Platform orchestration

Learned through building, not lectures.

### "How did you learn all this?"

12,500 AI conversations over 2.5 years = systematic pattern recognition.

I don't "learn" topics - I solve problems and learn what's needed along the way.

### "Can you work full-time or just contract?"

Open to both, depending on fit.

**Full-time** if:
- Remote or hybrid (1-2 days max)
- Company understands AI-native work
- Fair compensation
- Interesting technical problems

**Contract** if:
- Specific problem to solve
- Fixed scope or hourly
- Flexible schedule

### "What's your rate/salary expectation?"

Depends on:
- Type of work (contract vs full-time)
- Company stage (startup vs established)
- Problem complexity
- Remote vs hybrid vs office

**General range**:
- ₪300-400k/year full-time (comparable to senior dev doing team's worth of work)
- Contract: discuss based on scope

### "Why Beit Shemesh and not Tel Aviv?"

Religious community, family, lifestyle.

Proven I can ship production systems remotely. Location doesn't limit capability.

### "What kind of projects interest you?"

**Technically interesting**:
- AI/ML systems (RAG, embeddings, LLMs)
- Complex data pipelines
- Platform orchestration
- Performance optimization

**Practically useful**:
- Solving real business problems
- Production systems, not demos
- Measurable impact

**Not interested**:
- CRUD apps (boring)
- Maintenance-only roles
- Projects without technical challenge

## What Makes Me Different

### Not Better, Just Different

I'm not claiming to be better than teams. I'm different:

**Teams excel at**:
- Large codebases with history
- Coordination across many domains
- Politics and stakeholder management
- Long-term maintenance

**I excel at**:
- 0→1 building (MVP to production)
- Rapid iteration
- Platform-agnostic solutions
- Deep focus without coordination overhead

Different strengths for different problems.

### The AI-Native Difference

Most developers use AI as:
- Code completion tool
- Debugging assistant
- Documentation lookup

I use AI as:
- Architecture advisor
- Pattern recognition engine
- Rapid prototyping accelerator
- Knowledge base for unfamiliar domains

**Result**: 10x productivity increase, not 10% improvement.
