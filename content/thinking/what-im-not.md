# What I'm NOT Looking For

## Purpose
Save everyone time by being upfront about wrong-fit opportunities.

---

## Not Interested In

### Traditional Employment Patterns

**✗ "Junior" roles despite capabilities**

I've built production systems solo that teams of 5-10 build. Not interested in "junior" classification because I'm self-taught or lack a CS degree.

**Why**: The work speaks for itself. I'm not entry-level by any reasonable definition.

---

**✗ Multi-round technical interviews**

Not doing 5-round interview processes where:
- Round 1: HR screening
- Round 2: Technical phone screen
- Round 3: LeetCode whiteboard
- Round 4: System design
- Round 5: Cultural fit

**Why**: This tests algorithm memorization, not production capability. I'll show you what I've built instead.

---

**✗ Whiteboard algorithm tests**

Not interested in "reverse a binary tree" or "implement quicksort from memory" tests.

**Why**: Real work is:
- Can you architect a RAG system that works?
- Can you debug production issues?
- Can you ship features that users need?

Not: Can you remember CS101 algorithms?

---

**✗ "Send us your resume"**

I don't have a traditional resume. I have:
- GitHub repos
- Production systems running
- Documentation of what I've built
- This site

**Why**: Resumes optimize for credentials. I optimize for capability.

---

### Geographic Constraints

**✗ Relocating to Tel Aviv**

I'm in Beit Shemesh. Not moving.

**Why**: Religious community, family, lifestyle. Non-negotiable.

---

**✗ Daily office presence requirements**

Not doing 5 days/week in-office. Remote or hybrid (1-2 days max) only.

**Why**: Proven I can ship production systems remotely. Commute time = wasted development time.

---

### Equity-Only Arrangements

**✗ Building your MVP for equity**

Not interested in "no salary, just equity" offers.

**Why**: I have bills. Equity is fine as *additional* compensation, not sole compensation.

---

**✗ "Great opportunity, no cash but huge upside!"**

Seen this pattern. Usually means:
- Pre-product startup
- No funding
- "Exposure" instead of payment

**Why**: I'm past the stage where experience is compensation. I deliver value, expect fair payment.

## What I AM Interested In

### ✓ Problem-First Conversations

"Here's a technical challenge we're facing. Can you solve it?"

Not: "Tell me about yourself for 30 minutes."

---

### ✓ Show Your Work

"Show me what you've built, let's discuss your approach."

Not: "Here's a coding test that 1000 candidates take."

---

### ✓ Capabilities Over Credentials

"You built a RAG system with 253K messages? Walk me through your architecture."

Not: "Where did you go to university?"

---

### ✓ Remote-First or Hybrid

Companies that understand:
- Output > physical presence
- Async communication works
- Remote developers can ship

---

### ✓ AI-Native Understanding

Companies/people who know what's possible with:
- Claude Code, Cursor, Windsurf
- MCP servers
- Platform orchestration (Supabase + Vercel + Railway + etc.)

And value someone who's mastered these tools.

---

### ✓ Fair Compensation

Market rate for the value delivered, not discounted because "self-taught" or "no degree."

If I can do the work of 3 developers, don't offer junior developer salary.

---

## How To Approach Me

### Good Approaches:

✓ "Saw your RAG system. We're building similar. Want to discuss?"
✓ "Have a production problem with vector search. Can you help?"
✓ "Looking for someone who can ship fast with AI tools. Interested?"

### Bad Approaches:

✗ "Submit your CV to our hiring portal"
✗ "Can you do a 4-hour take-home test?"
✗ "Great opportunity to learn and grow!" (I'm past entry-level)

## Contact Preferences

**Email**: [YOUR_EMAIL] - Best for first contact

**LinkedIn**: [YOUR_LINKEDIN] - For professional connections

**Not Available**:
- Phone calls without context
- "Jump on a quick call" (send agenda first)
- WhatsApp recruiting spam

---

## The Right Fit

If you:
- Have a real technical problem
- Value capability over credentials
- Understand AI-native development
- Offer remote/hybrid flexibility
- Provide fair compensation

**Then let's talk.**

If not, we're both saving time by being honest upfront.
