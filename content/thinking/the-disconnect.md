# How I Think: The Disconnect

## Question
Why do successful Israeli companies still hire like it's 2021?

## Surface Answer (Layer 1)
I can demonstrably do the work of a 3-5 person dev team with AI tools (Claude Code, Cursor, MCPs). But job posts still ask for "5 years experience, CS degree, ₪30k/month team member." The market hasn't caught up to what one person can do in 2025.

## Expand: The Full Context (Layer 2)

### What I See

**2021 Hiring**:
- "Senior Full-Stack Developer"
- "5+ years experience required"
- "CS degree or equivalent"
- "₪25-30k/month"
- "Team of 5-10 developers"
- "Agile/Scrum ceremonies"
- Multi-round interviews testing algorithm memorization

**2025 Reality** (What I Can Do):
- One person with Claude Code
- Production RAG system (253K messages) in days
- 3-tier microservices (WOTC app) solo
- Platform-agnostic solutions (Supabase + Vercel + Railway + Google APIs)
- Faster, often better, definitely cheaper

**The Disconnect**: Companies optimize for 2021 constraints that no longer exist.

### Why The Gap Exists

**Reason 1: VCs Demand Headcount Growth**
- "We're scaling" = hiring 50 people
- Boards understand "team of 10 devs", not "1 AI-native dev shipping 10x"
- Metrics are people-count, not output-per-person

**Reason 2: Risk Aversion**
- Known pattern: hire 5 devs with CS degrees = safe
- Unknown pattern: hire 1 self-taught AI-native dev = risky (to them)
- Even if evidence shows it works, breaks their mental model

**Reason 3: Cultural Inertia**
- Israeli tech playbook: 8200 → CS degree → startup → scale team
- This worked for 20 years, hard to change
- "We've always done it this way" is powerful

**Reason 4: Leaders Don't Know It's Possible**
- Most CTOs are 40-50 years old
- Haven't used Claude Code for 2.5 years like I have
- Don't know what's possible with AI-assisted development
- Their experience is pre-AI paradigm

### What This Means For Me

I'm **2-3 years ahead** of the market's understanding.

**Problem**: What do you do when you're right but early?

**Options**:
1. **Wait** - Market catches up in 2026-2027
2. **Compromise** - Take traditional role, use AI secretly, get promoted fast
3. **Go Around** - Find US remote companies that already get it
4. **Create** - Build something so undeniable they have to notice

Currently exploring options 1 and 4.

## Expand: The Evidence (Layer 3)

### What Traditional Team Does

**Typical 5-Person Dev Team**:
- Frontend dev (React/Next.js)
- Backend dev (Python/Node)
- DevOps/Infrastructure
- QA/Testing
- Product/Project coordination

**Timeline for RAG system**: 3-6 months
**Cost**: ₪150-200k total (₪30k × 5 people × 1-2 months minimum)

### What I Did Solo

**Sparkii RAG System**:
- Frontend: Next.js UI (in progress)
- Backend: FastAPI with 4 endpoints
- Infrastructure: Supabase (PostgreSQL + pgvector)
- Testing: Manual + API testing
- Coordination: Just me

**Timeline**: Day 1 to working API in ~8 hours
**Cost**: My time + API costs (~$50 for embeddings)

**Difference**: 100x faster, 1000x cheaper, comparable quality

### WOTC Tax Processing

**Traditional Approach**:
- Frontend team: Next.js UI
- Backend team: PDF extraction, field mapping
- DevOps: Deploy 3 services (Vercel + 2 Railway)
- DBA: Design 109-column schema
- QA: Test end-to-end

**Team size**: 5-7 people
**Timeline**: 4-6 months
**Cost**: ₪200-300k

**What I Did**:
- All of the above
- Solo
- ~3-4 weeks
- Cost: Hosting ($50/month) + my time

**Difference**: Same outcome, 1 person, weeks not months

### Why This Works

**It's not magic. It's**:
1. **Pattern recognition** - Most problems are variations of solved problems
2. **Efficient iteration** - AI accelerates feedback loops
3. **Platform-agnostic** - Don't rebuild, orchestrate existing services
4. **Focus** - No meetings, no coordination overhead, deep work only
5. **AI assistance** - Claude Code knows thousands of patterns I'd take years to learn

## What I'm NOT Saying

**NOT saying**: "AI replaces all developers"

**Saying**: "One AI-native developer can replace many traditional developers for certain types of work"

**NOT saying**: "I'm better than teams"

**Saying**: "For 80% of startup MVPs, my approach is faster and cheaper"

**NOT saying**: "Traditional hiring is always wrong"

**Saying**: "For companies building AI-native products, 2021 hiring practices are mismatched"

## Who Already Gets It

### Companies That Understand (Rare):

**US-based**:
- Replit (shipping AI-assisted development tools)
- Vercel (enabling solo developers to ship fast)
- Small YC startups (post-YC, pre-Series A)

**Israel-based** (very rare):
- Superlinked (vector search - they'd understand RAG)
- Maybe: Early-stage AI startups with technical founders
- Individual CTOs who've experimented with Claude Code

**The Pattern**: Either building AI tools themselves, or run by people who use them daily

## The Question I'm Asking

Not: "How do I convince companies to hire me?"

But: "Why don't successful companies see what I see?"

And: "Where are the people who already get it?"

**That's what I'm trying to understand.**
